\section{Enhanced System Description}
Angry Birds Alike, inspired by the dynamics of "Angry Birds Game", is a sophisticated physics engine designed for educational simulations. It focuses on demonstrating intermediate to advanced physics mechanisms such as force, velocity, elastic collision, and momentum transfer. The engine utilizes mathematical formulas, specifically the Runge-Kutta 4 (RK4) method, to solve projectile trajectories accurately.

    \item \textbf{Boost.odeint:} A comprehensive C++ library employed for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs), crucial for simulating the physics interactions within the game.
    \item \textbf{C++ Standard Library Features:} Including Arrays for data management, cmath for mathematical calculations, chrono for managing time, and thread for optimizing performance through multi-threading.
\end{itemize}

\section{Physics Simulation Walkthrough}
The core of ProgName's simulation is built on accurately determining the trajectory of projectiles under various forces. This is achieved through the RK4 method, allowing for precise calculation of distances covered by the projectiles.

\subsection{RK4 Method Implementation}
Given the differential equations:

\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = vx, \quad \frac{dy}{dt} = vy, \quad \frac{dvx}{dt} = 0, \quad \frac{dvy}{dt} = g
\]

where \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity. With initial conditions at \(t_0\) set as \(x_0 = 0\), \(y_0 = 0\), \(vx_0 = 10m/s\), and \(vy_0 = 10m/s\), we find the state after a timestep \(\Delta t = 1s\), applying the RK4 method.

\subsubsection{Projectile System Walkthrough}
This section details the calculation steps using RK4, from initial velocity setup to updating the state with a weighted average of the slopes (k values), and finally providing a summary of one timestep's calculation.

\section{Physics Mechanics Demonstrations}
\subsection{Force Application to Velocity}
Demonstrates the conversion of applied force into initial speed and direction, affecting the projectile's trajectory.\\
--Set the initial conditions for projectile motion by adjusting the launch angle (\(\theta\)) and the force (\(F\)), determining the initial velocity (\(v_0 = \frac{F}{m}\)), where \(m\) is the projectile's mass.

\subsection{Elastic Collision and Momentum Transfer}
Details the simulation of elastic collisions between entities, showcasing momentum conservation and transfer according to physics laws.\\
--Elastic collisions conserve both momentum and kinetic energy. For two colliding objects, momentum conservation is expressed as \(m_1v_{1,initial} + m_2v_{2,initial} = m_1v_{1,final} + m_2v_{2,final}\), and kinetic energy conservation as \(\frac{1}{2}m_1v_{1,initial}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2v_{2,initial}^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_1v_{1,final}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2v_{2,final}^2\).
