\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection{Problem}

This project aims to develop a physics-based gaming application focusing on realistic collision dynamics and gravitational interactions. The game will be developed in C++/C\# or JavaScript, providing an engaging and interactive environment for players to explore physics concepts.

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\subsubsection{Gameplay Dynamics}
\textbf{Input}: Player interactions through controls.
\textbf{Output}: Real-time response in game physics and mechanics.

\subsubsection{Physics Simulation}
\textbf{Input}: Environmental parameters, object properties.
\textbf{Output}: Realistic object movements and interactions.

\subsection{Stakeholders}
The primary stakeholders are the game developers, players, and the educational community that may use the game as a teaching tool.

\section{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop an interactive game with realistic physics.
    \item Create engaging content that educates players about physics.
\end{itemize}

\section{Stretch Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Include advanced physics concepts like fluid dynamics.
    \item Implement a level editor for custom gameplay experiences.
\end{itemize}

% You can include additional sections such as 'Appendix' as per your project requirement.
