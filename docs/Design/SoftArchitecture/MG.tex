\section{Introduction}

Decomposing a system into modules is a widely accepted approach to developing software. A module can be thought of as a work assignment for a programmer or programming team. We adopt a decomposition strategy based on the principle of information hiding, as suggested by Parnas (1972). This principle supports the design for change, as the "secrets" each module conceals are those aspects of the system most likely to change. This approach is particularly valuable in software development environments where modifications are frequent.

For "Angry Birds Alike", the module design has been constructed to adapt to changes with minimal impact on the overall system. Our design adheres to the rules set out by Parnas and colleagues (1984):

\begin{itemize}
    \item System details that are likely to change independently are the "secrets" of separate modules.
    \item Each data structure is encapsulated within a single module.
    \item Access to a module's data structure is only possible through its defined interface.
\end{itemize}

Following the completion of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and Verification and Validation Plan, we developed this Module Guide (MG). The MG delineates the system's modular structure, allowing designers and maintainers to identify software components efficiently.

Intended readers of this document include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{New project members:} To provide a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, facilitating a quicker onboarding process.
    \item \textbf{Maintainers:} To improve understanding of the system's modular structure for efficient maintenance and enhancement activities.
    \item \textbf{Designers:} To use the MG as a tool for verifying the system's consistency, feasibility, and adaptability to changes.
\end{itemize}

The design for "Angry Birds Alike" emphasizes modularity, anticipating the potential evolution of both software and hardware environments. The subsequent sections will detail the anticipated and unlikely changes, module hierarchy, and the connections between the system's requirements and its design.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes}

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design}

This section outlines how the design of "Angry Birds Alike" satisfies the specific requirements identified in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS). The system's modular structure is directly influenced by these requirements, ensuring that each component of the game fulfills a distinct set of criteria.

\subsection{Requirements to Module Mapping}

The design decisions taken in the module structure are directly derived from the needs and functionalities described in the SRS. Below is a table mapping the main requirements of the system to the modules that implement them:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Requirement} & \textbf{Responsible Module(s)} \\
\hline
Game Physics Simulation & M3.1: Physics Engine Module \\
User Interaction & M2.2: User Interface Module, M3.3: Input Handling Module \\
Graphics Rendering & M3.2: Graphics Rendering Module \\
Level Progression & M2.1: Game Logic Module \\
Score and Achievement Tracking & M2.1: Game Logic Module \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Mapping of Requirements to Modules}
\label{tab:requirements-to-modules}
\end{table}

\subsection{Design Rationale}

\textbf{M3.1: Physics Engine Module} encapsulates all functionalities related to the physics simulations, including projectile motion and collision detection, directly addressing the game physics simulation requirement.

\textbf{M2.2: User Interface Module} and \textbf{M3.3: Input Handling Module} together ensure that the game responds accurately to user inputs, covering everything from in-game actions to navigating the game's menus.

\textbf{M3.2: Graphics Rendering Module}, leveraging the SFML library, is tasked with drawing all visual elements on the screen, satisfying the requirement for engaging and dynamic graphics.

\section{Appendix}

\subsection{Game Physics and Projectile Motion}

The physics behind projectile motion in "Angry Birds Alike" is based on classical mechanics. The trajectory of the birds when launched is determined by the initial velocity, launch angle, and the acceleration due to gravity.

\subsubsection*{Projectile Motion Formulas}

The following equations describe the motion of the projectile (bird):
\begin{itemize}
    \item RK4 Method.
    \item Horizontal position: \( x(t) = v_{0x} \cdot t \)
    \item Vertical position: \( y(t) = v_{0y} \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \)
    \item Initial velocity components:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( v_{0x} = v_0 \cdot \cos(\theta) \)
        \item \( v_{0y} = v_0 \cdot \sin(\theta) \)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( v_0 \) is the launch speed.
        \item \( \theta \) is the launch angle.
        \item \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 \( m/s^2 \) on Earth).
        \item \( t \) is the time after launch.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Hitting the Target}
The objective is to adjust the launch velocity and angle to hit the target. This requires calculating the optimal angle and velocity to overcome obstacles and reach the pigs.

\subsubsection*{Elastic Collisions and Momentum Transfer}
When the bird hits a pig or an object, an elastic collision may occur, transferring momentum according to the conservation laws. The momentum transfer is calculated using the masses and velocities of the colliding objects.

\subsection{Annotated Game Physics}

Here we describe the projectile motion as seen in the game. The projectile follows a parabolic trajectory under the influence of gravity, without air resistance.
